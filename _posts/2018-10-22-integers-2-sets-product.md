Lets take a look at a riddle. 

##Q1: Equal Product of <font size="5">&integers;</font> 1 - 20

#### Question
Your given a bag filled with the integers (<font size="4">&integers;</font>) 1 - 20 inclusive.
Your tasked with spilitting these **Integers** into **2** sets such that the product of *Set A* and *Set B* are equal. Is it possible to fulfill your task (Split them up according to the rules mentioned above) *or* is this task impossible. 


#### Answer
⚠️ **Spoiler Alert**.. Always try to solve the riddles yourself first ⚠️ 

The task is impossible. We can prove this through a proof by contradiction. 

Imagine you **were** able to split up the first 20 Integers into 2 sets such that the product of *Set A* and the product of *Set B* are equal. We can say that the product of *Set A* is equal to <font size="4">𝒏</font> and the product of *Set B* is equalt to <font size="4">𝒎</font>

So we have,

<font size="4">&prod;</font> *Set A* = <font size="4">𝒎</font>
<br> <font size="4">&prod;</font> *Set B*  = <font size="4">𝒏</font>

Since we are assuming we are able to complete this task, we can write <font size="4">𝒎</font> = <font size="4">𝒏</font>

We know from Number Theory that every number has a **Unique Prime Factorization**. This just means that we can write any number as a product of primes and that there is only **1** way to do so.

What follows from this is that the **Unique Prime Factorization** of <font size="4">𝒎</font> must be the same **Unique Prime Factorization** as <font size="4">𝒏</font>. This ends up being impossible. 

Notice how 19 is a Prime. 

This means that 19 is either in *Set A's Factorization* or *Set B's Factorization* but **NOT BOTH**

This means that  *Set A's Factorization* is different from *Set B's Factorization* which means 
<font size="4">&prod;</font> *Set A* <font size="4">≠</font> <font size="4">&prod;</font> *Set B* <sub>◼︎</sub>

##Q2: Equal Product of <font size="5">&integers;</font> n - n+19
