Lets take a look at another riddle. 

## Q1: Jugs and A Ladder

#### Question
Before you is a 100 rung ladder <img src="http://clipart-library.com/img/686645.png" width=40/>

You have in your hands 2 *breakable* jugs.
Your job is to find, in the minimal number of drops, the *highest* rung in which a jug, when dropped, will **not break**.

Note: The trivial way to find the highest rung (which is not the minimal number of drops) is to test rung 1 then 2 then 3....n)

Note 2: If a jug is dropped and does not break, you may retrieve that jug and continue.

What is the minimal drop of steps required to find the highest rung in which the jug will not break & what method did you use to solve it.
