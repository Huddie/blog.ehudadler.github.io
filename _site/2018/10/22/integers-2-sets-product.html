<p>Lets take a look at a riddle.</p>

<p>##Q1: Equal Product of <font size="5">&integers;</font> 1 - 20</p>

<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>Your given a bag filled with the integers (<font size="4">&integers;</font>) 1 - 20 inclusive.
Your tasked with spilitting these <strong>Integers</strong> into <strong>2</strong> sets such that the product of <em>Set A</em> and <em>Set B</em> are equal. Is it possible to fulfill your task (Split them up according to the rules mentioned above) <em>or</em> is this task impossible.</p>

<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Spoiler Alert</strong>.. Always try to solve the riddles yourself first ⚠️</p>

<p>The task is impossible. We can prove this through a proof by contradiction.</p>

<p>Imagine you <strong>were</strong> able to split up the first 20 Integers into 2 sets such that the product of <em>Set A</em> and the product of <em>Set B</em> are equal. We can say that the product of <em>Set A</em> is equal to <font size="4">𝒏</font> and the product of <em>Set B</em> is equalt to <font size="4">𝒎</font></p>

<p>So we have,</p>

<font size="4">&prod;</font>
<p><em>Set A</em> = <font size="4">𝒎</font>
<br /> <font size="4">&prod;</font> <em>Set B</em>  = <font size="4">𝒏</font></p>

<p>Since we are assuming we are able to complete this task, we can write <font size="4">𝒎</font> = <font size="4">𝒏</font></p>

<p>We know from Number Theory that every number has a <strong>Unique Prime Factorization</strong>. This just means that we can write any number as a product of primes and that there is only <strong>1</strong> way to do so.</p>

<p>What follows from this is that the <strong>Unique Prime Factorization</strong> of <font size="4">𝒎</font> must be the same <strong>Unique Prime Factorization</strong> as <font size="4">𝒏</font>. This ends up being impossible.</p>

<p>Notice how 19 is a Prime.</p>

<p>This means that 19 is either in <em>Set A’s Factorization</em> or <em>Set B’s Factorization</em> but <strong>NOT BOTH</strong></p>

<p>This means that  <em>Set A’s Factorization</em> is different from <em>Set B’s Factorization</em> which means</p>
<font size="4">&prod;</font>
<p><em>Set A</em> <font size="4">≠</font> <font size="4">&prod;</font> <em>Set B</em> <sub>◼︎</sub></p>

<p>##Q2: Equal Product of <font size="5">&integers;</font> n - n+19</p>
